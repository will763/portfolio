# Portfolio 📖

This project was developed during the TQI Fullstack Developer bootcamp on 
the Digital innovation one platform.after watching an expert build an amazing
portfolio with animations, all done with vanillaJs. I decided to create my own,
so I went searching the figma community for templates to inspire me.

The final project that I developed is a compilation of several projects,
in which I put what I found most cool and essential in a portfolio. I used
the powerful GreenSock animation library along with its ScrollTrigger plugin
to make animations on the page as the user scrolls down.

## What I learned 🧑‍💻

I learned to create animations with the GreenSock library, to fade-in components.
I put into practice the combination of scrollTrigger with GreenSock to make effects as
the user goes down the site. The scrollTrigger is used to know if the element is visible
in the viewport, with this it is possible to create fantastic animations.
